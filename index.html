            <h1>What Work Was Done</h1>
            <p>A comprehensive CLI tool was developed to manage FreeCAD preferences, enabling users to interact with FreeCAD configurations directly from the command line. The tool provides a range of features to customize preferences, including the ability to list, read, write, and remove preferences. Users can access preferences stored in files, modify existing configurations, and create new settings with ease. The tool's functionality is designed to simplify preference management, offering a user-friendly interface for efficient customization.</p>
            <p>Command Designed Pattern has been implemented to ensure scalability and maintainability. This pairs well with the Commandline Interface Tool as the command can be selected at runtime by the user and an Invoker can then execute the command that was selected.</p>
